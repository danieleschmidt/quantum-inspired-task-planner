# Project Charter: Quantum-Inspired Task Planner

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
To revolutionize multi-agent task scheduling by providing quantum-inspired optimization that delivers exponential performance improvements over classical methods while maintaining seamless integration with existing agent frameworks.

### Mission
Develop a production-ready, quantum-enabled task scheduling system that solves the combinatorial explosion problem in multi-agent systems through QUBO formulations and hybrid quantum-classical optimization.

## Project Scope

### Problem Statement
Traditional task schedulers struggle with the NP-hard nature of optimal assignment problems when dealing with:
- Large numbers of agents (50+) with diverse skill sets

A quantum-inspired optimization system that:
- Converts scheduling problems to QUBO format
- Leverages quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computers
- Provides classical fallbacks for reliability
- Integrates natively with popular agent frameworks
