# ADR-001: Quantum Backend Abstraction Layer

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The quantum-inspired task planner needs to support multiple quantum computing backends (D-Wave, Azure Quantum, IBM Quantum) and classical fallbacks. Each backend has different APIs, capabilities, and constraints. We need a unified interface that allows:

1. Seamless switching between backends based on problem characteristics
2. Automatic fallback when quantum devices are unavailable
3. Easy addition of new backends without core system changes
4. Performance optimization through backend-specific tuning

## Decision
We will implement a plugin-based backend abstraction layer with the following components:

### Core Interface
```python
class QuantumBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def solve_qubo(self, Q: np.ndarray) -> Dict[int, int]
    
    @abstractmethod
    def estimate_solve_time(self, problem_size: int) -> float
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_device_properties(self) -> DeviceInfo
    
    @abstractmethod
    def validate_problem(self, Q: np.ndarray) -> ValidationResult
```

### Backend Manager
- Maintains registry of available backends
- Routes problems based on size, constraints, and availability
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Implements fallback chains and retry logic

### Configuration System
- YAML-based backend configuration
- Environment variable support for credentials
- Runtime backend preference overrides
- Problem-specific backend selection rules

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new quantum providers as they become available
- **Reliability**: Automatic fallback ensures problems always get solved
- **Performance**: Backend selection optimizes for problem characteristics
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one backend don't affect others
- **Testing**: Mock backends enable comprehensive unit testing

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer adds complexity
- **Overhead**: Backend selection logic adds small performance cost
- **Consistency**: Different backends may produce slightly different results
- **Debugging**: Harder to debug issues that span multiple backends

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive logging and tracing across backend switches
- Standardized result validation and quality metrics
- Performance benchmarking to optimize backend selection
- Clear documentation of backend capabilities and limitations

## Implementation Notes

### Backend Selection Algorithm
```python
def select_backend(problem_size, constraints, user_preference):
    # 1. Check user override
    if user_preference and is_backend_available(user_preference):
        return user_preference
    
    # 2. Problem size thresholds
    if problem_size <= 10:
        return "classical_exact"
    elif problem_size <= 50 and quantum_available():
        return "quantum_annealing"
    else:
        return "classical_heuristic"
    
    # 3. Constraint-based selection
    if has_time_windows(constraints):
        return prefer_hybrid_backend()
    
    # 4. Fallback chain
    return get_fallback_chain()[0]
```

### Error Handling
- Network timeouts trigger immediate fallback
- Authentication failures logged and reported
- Partial results saved before attempting fallback
- Rate limiting handled with exponential backoff
