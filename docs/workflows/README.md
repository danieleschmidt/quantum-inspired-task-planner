- **Deployment Monitoring**: Health checks and validation
- **Alerting**: Slack, email, and PagerDuty integration

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup

1. **Copy Workflow Files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/*.yml .github/workflows/
   cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/codeql/ .github/workflows/ -r
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets**: See [WORKFLOW_SETUP_GUIDE.md](WORKFLOW_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions

3. **Enable Branch Protection**: Configure required status checks and approval rules

### Detailed Setup

For comprehensive setup instructions, see [WORKFLOW_SETUP_GUIDE.md](WORKFLOW_SETUP_GUIDE.md), which includes:

- Required secrets and environment variables
- Branch protection configuration
- Environment setup (staging/production)
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Troubleshooting guide

## Workflow Architecture

### CI Pipeline Flow
```
Push/PR → Security Scan → Code Quality → Tests → Build → E2E → Validation
```

### CD Pipeline Flow
```
Main Branch → Pre-checks → Build → Deploy Staging → Validate → Deploy Production → Monitor
```

### Security Pipeline Flow
```
Schedule/PR → Dependency Scan → Code Analysis → Container Scan → Secrets Scan → Report
```

## Quantum-Specific Features

### Backend Testing
- Automated testing against D-Wave, Azure Quantum, and IBM Quantum
- Classical fallback validation
- Performance benchmarking across backends
- Credential validation and rotation

### Security Scanning
- Quantum API key detection and validation
- Quantum-specific vulnerability patterns
- Backend connectivity and quota monitoring
- Encryption standard validation

### Performance Monitoring
- Quantum solve time tracking
- Classical fallback rate monitoring
- Queue depth and throughput analysis
- Cost optimization tracking

## Manual Setup Requirements

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the following must be set up manually:

### Repository Settings
- Branch protection rules
- Required status checks
- Environment configuration
- Secrets management

### External Integrations
- Container registry authentication
- Kubernetes cluster configuration
- Monitoring system integration
- Alert routing configuration

### Security Configuration
- CodeQL advanced configuration
- Security scanning tool integration
- Vulnerability management workflow
- Incident response procedures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review security scan results and dependency updates
- **Monthly**: Update workflow dependencies and validate configurations
- **Quarterly**: Audit access permissions and test disaster recovery

### Key Metrics
- Build success rate and duration
- Security scan coverage and findings
- Deployment frequency and success rate
- Performance regression detection

### Alerting
- Failed builds and deployments
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation
- Quota and rate limit warnings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Workflow Permissions**: Ensure required permissions are granted
- **Secret Configuration**: Verify all required secrets are properly set
- **Quantum Backend Access**: Check API tokens and quota limits
- **Resource Limits**: Monitor compute and storage usage

### Debug Steps
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
2. Verify environment configuration
3. Test locally using act or similar tools
4. Review security and compliance reports

## Contributing

When modifying workflows:

1. Test changes in a fork first
2. Update documentation
3. Follow security best practices
4. Ensure backward compatibility
5. Update related scripts and configurations
