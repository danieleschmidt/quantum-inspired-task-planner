# GitHub Workflows Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the comprehensive CI/CD workflows for the Quantum-Inspired Task Planner project.

## Overview

The project includes the following workflow templates:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)** - Automated testing, quality checks, and validation
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)** - Automated deployment to staging and production
3. **Security Scanning** - Comprehensive security analysis and vulnerability detection
4. **Dependency Management** - Automated dependency updates and vulnerability patching
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Performance regression testing and monitoring

```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Copy Workflow Files

Copy the workflow templates from `docs/workflows/examples/` to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy workflow templates
cp docs/workflows/examples/ci-template.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
cp docs/workflows/examples/cd-template.yml .github/workflows/cd.yml
cp docs/workflows/examples/security-scanning-template.yml .github/workflows/security.yml

# Copy additional workflows from workflows-ready-to-deploy/
cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/dependabot-auto-merge.yml .github/workflows/
cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/performance.yml .github/workflows/
cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/release.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Configure CodeQL

Copy the CodeQL configuration:

```bash
# Create CodeQL directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows/codeql

# Copy CodeQL configuration
cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/codeql/codeql-config.yml .github/workflows/codeql/
```

### Step 3: Update Repository Settings

#### Branch Protection Rules

Configure branch protection for `main` branch:

1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Configure the following settings:
   - âœ… Require a pull request before merging
   - âœ… Require approvals (minimum 1)
   - âœ… Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - âœ… Require review from code owners
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
   - âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - âœ… Include administrators

#### Required Status Checks

Add the following status checks:

- `Security Scan / codeql`
- `Code Quality / code-quality`
- `Tests / test`
- `Build and Test Docker Image / build`
- `Final Validation / validation`

#### Environment Configuration

Create the following environments:

**Staging Environment:**
- Name: `staging`
- Deployment protection rules: None (auto-deploy)
- Environment secrets: staging-specific credentials

**Production Environment:**
- Name: `production`
- Deployment protection rules: Required reviewers
- Environment secrets: production-specific credentials

### Step 4: Configure Dependabot

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
      time: "06:00"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "your-team/security"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"

  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

### Step 5: Configure Issue and PR Templates

Create issue templates:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

# Bug report template
cat > .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml << 'EOF'

Run the validation script:

```bash
python scripts/validate_workflow_config.py
```

git push origin main
```

2. Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
3. Enable workflows if prompted
4. Monitor first workflow runs

## Workflow Descriptions

### CI Workflow (ci.yml)

**Trigger:** Push to main/develop, PRs, manual dispatch

**Jobs:**
- Security scan with multiple tools
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Unit and integration tests across Python versions
- Performance benchmarks
- Docker image build and security scan
- End-to-end tests
- SBOM generation
- Documentation validation

### CD Workflow (cd.yml)

**Trigger:** Push to main, tags, manual dispatch

**Jobs:**
- Deployment target determination
- Pre-deployment safety checks
- Container image build and push
- Staging deployment with smoke tests
- Production deployment with blue-green strategy
- Post-deployment verification
- Emergency rollback capability
- Release creation

### Security Workflow (security.yml)

**Trigger:** Push, PRs, weekly schedule, manual dispatch

**Jobs:**
- CodeQL static analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image security analysis
- Secrets detection
- Infrastructure as Code security
- SLSA compliance verification
- License compliance checking
- Custom quantum-specific security checks

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks

- Review security scan results
- Check dependency update PRs
- Monitor deployment success rates
- Review performance benchmarks

### Monthly Tasks

- Update workflow dependencies
- Review and update security policies
- Audit access permissions
- Test disaster recovery procedures

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Workflow Fails on Secrets:**
- Verify all required secrets are configured
- Check secret names match workflow references
- Ensure base64 encoding for KUBE_CONFIG secrets

**Quantum Backend Tests Fail:**
- Check API token validity
- Verify backend availability
- Review quota limits

**Deployment Failures:**
- Verify Kubernetes connectivity
- Check resource quotas
- Review deployment logs

#### Getting Help

- Check workflow logs in Actions tab
- Review documentation in `docs/`
- Create issue using bug report template
- Contact team via configured channels

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Monitor secret usage

### Access Control

- Limit workflow permissions
- Use principle of least privilege
- Audit access regularly
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Compliance

- All workflows generate audit logs
- Security scans are mandatory
- SLSA compliance verified
- License compliance checked

## Next Steps

After setting up workflows:

1. Test with a sample PR
2. Monitor workflow execution
3. Adjust configuration as needed
4. Train team on workflow usage
5. Set up monitoring dashboards
6. Configure alerting for failures
