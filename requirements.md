# Project Requirements

## Problem Statement

The Quantum-Inspired Task Planner addresses the complex challenge of optimal task assignment in multi-agent systems. Traditional schedulers fail to handle the combinatorial explosion when assigning tasks to agents with diverse skills, capacities, and constraints. This project provides a quantum-inspired solution using QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulations to achieve exponential speedups for large-scale scheduling problems.
