```
ICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease
```
- **Impact**: Strategic importance and reach
- **Confidence**: Certainty in estimates and outcomes
- **Ease**: Implementation simplicity and resource availability

#### Technical Debt Assessment - 25% Weight
```
TechDebt = Σ(Complexity × Security × Performance × Maintainability × Coverage)
```
- **Code Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity and architectural issues
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Risk level and exposure
- **Performance Impact**: Speed, memory, scalability concerns
- **Maintainability**: Code quality and documentation gaps
- **Test Coverage**: Testing gaps and quality issues

#### Quantum Computing Boost - 15% Weight
```
QuantumBoost = Domain × Performance × Cost × Research × Innovation
```
- **Domain Expertise**: Quantum-specific optimization opportunities
- **Performance Impact**: Quantum vs classical algorithm improvements
- **Cost Optimization**: Quantum resource utilization efficiency
- **Research Value**: Integration of latest quantum computing research
- **Innovation Potential**: Breakthrough algorithm opportunities

### Dynamic Scoring Example

```python
# Critical Security Task
task = TaskMetrics(
    title="Implement Quantum Backend Authentication Security",
    category=TaskCategory.SECURITY,
    urgency=UrgencyLevel.CRITICAL,
    user_business_value=9.5,
    security_vulnerability=9.5,
    quantum_domain=QuantumDomain.QUANTUM_SECURITY,
    quantum_performance_impact=3.0
)

# Calculated Score: 94.2 (Critical Priority)
