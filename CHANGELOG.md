## Release History

### Version Numbering

This project uses semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions  
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Development**: Features developed on feature branches
2. **Integration**: Merge to `develop` branch for integration testing
3. **Release Candidate**: Create release branch from `develop`
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on quantum and classical backends
5. **Release**: Merge to `main` and tag with version number
6. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to production environments

### Support Policy

- **Latest Major Version**: Full support with security updates and bug fixes
- **Previous Major Version**: Security updates only for 12 months
- **Older Versions**: End of life, upgrade recommended

### Migration Guides

#### Upgrading to v2.0 (Planned)
- Enhanced quantum backend API with improved error handling
- New multi-objective optimization interface
- Breaking changes in framework integration APIs
- Migration scripts and documentation will be provided

#### Upgrading from v1.x to v1.y
- Backwards compatible changes only
- Optional feature adoption
- Deprecation warnings for features planned for removal
