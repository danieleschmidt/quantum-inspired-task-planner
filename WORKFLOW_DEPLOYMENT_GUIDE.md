# 🚀 Production-Ready GitHub Workflows Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide contains production-ready GitHub workflows that complete the SDLC maturity enhancement for the quantum-inspired task planner repository. Due to GitHub App security restrictions, these workflows need to be manually deployed.

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Deploy Workflow Files
```bash
# Copy workflows to .github/workflows/
cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Create CodeQL directory and copy config
mkdir -p .github/codeql
cp workflows-ready-to-deploy/codeql/codeql-config.yml .github/codeql/
```

### Step 2: Configure Repository Secrets
Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

**Required Secrets:**
- `PYPI_TOKEN`: Your PyPI API token for automated package publishing
  - Get from: https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
  - Scope: Entire account (or specific to this project)

**Optional Secrets (Enhanced Features):**
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For advanced coverage reporting
  - Get from: https://codecov.io/ after linking your repository
- `SCORECARD_TOKEN`: For OSSF Scorecard security analysis
  - Get from: https://github.com/settings/tokens (read-only scope)

### Step 3: Enable Branch Protection
1. Go to **Settings → Branches**
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators
   - **Required status checks:**
     - `Code Quality`
     - `Unit Tests (ubuntu-latest, 3.11)`
     - `Build Package`
     - `CodeQL`

### Step 4: Configure Dependabot Auto-merge
1. Go to **Settings → General → Pull Requests**
2. ✅ Enable "Allow auto-merge"
3. ✅ Enable "Automatically delete head branches"
