   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-inspired-task-planner.git
   cd quantum-inspired-task-planner
   ```
3. **Set up development environment**:

## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Poetry
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install --with dev,test,docs

# Setup pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests
make test

# Start development server
make dev
```

### Using Dev Container
```bash
# Open in VS Code with Dev Container extension
code .
# Command palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

## üß™ Testing

We maintain high test coverage and quality standards:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit          # Unit tests only
make test-integration   # Integration tests
make test-quantum       # Quantum backend tests (requires credentials)
make benchmark          # Performance benchmarks

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/quantum_planner --cov-report=html
```

### Test Guidelines
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Quantum tests**: Test with real quantum backends (mark with `@pytest.mark.quantum`)
- **Property-based tests**: Use Hypothesis for generating test cases
- **Benchmarks**: Performance regression tests

## üéØ What We're Looking For

### High Priority Contributions
- **New quantum backends** (IonQ, Rigetti, PennyLane)
- **Classical solver implementations** (SA, GA, Tabu Search improvements)
- **Framework integrations** (new agent frameworks)
- **Performance optimizations** (QUBO construction, matrix operations)
- **Documentation improvements** (tutorials, examples, API docs)

### Good First Issues
Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are designed for newcomers and include:
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage increases
- Small feature additions
- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps

## üìù Code Standards

### Code Style
- **Formatting**: Black with 88-character line length
- **Linting**: Ruff for code quality
- **Type hints**: Required for all public APIs
- **Docstrings**: Google style for all public functions/classes

### Pre-commit Hooks
We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files  # Run all hooks
pre-commit autoupdate       # Update hook versions
```

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated (docstrings, README, examples)
- [ ] Type hints added for new code
- [ ] Performance impact considered for hot paths
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## üî¨ Quantum Development Guidelines

### Quantum Backend Development
When adding new quantum backends:

1. **Implement the `QuantumBackend` interface**:
   ```python
   class NewQuantumBackend(QuantumBackend):
       def solve_qubo(self, Q: np.ndarray) -> Dict[int, int]:
           # Implementation
       
       def estimate_solve_time(self, problem_size: int) -> float:
           # Implementation
   ```

2. **Add configuration support** in backend registry
3. **Include comprehensive tests** with mocked quantum devices
4. **Add integration tests** (marked with `@pytest.mark.quantum`)
5. **Update documentation** with setup instructions

### Quantum Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.quantum
@pytest.mark.requires_credentials
def test_dwave_integration():
    """Test D-Wave integration with real device."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Error Handling
Quantum backends should gracefully handle:
- Network timeouts
- Authentication failures
- Device unavailability
- Problem size limitations
